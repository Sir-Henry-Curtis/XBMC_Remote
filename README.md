XBMC_Remote
===========

remote control support for XBMC

script.rss.editor was used as a template for this script and for the skin.


service.qlock  was used as the template for the service.irremote.  This folder also contains the libraries for xbmc_client, adodb, and pyserial.

This program works for me, but it needs alot of clean up, and the ability to learn needs to be added to the arduino so that it can use remotes that are not readily recognized.
